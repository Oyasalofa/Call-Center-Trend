3. **Calculated New Measures with DAX functions;**
- Average Satisfaction Rating = AVERAGE('Call Center'[Satisfaction rating])
- Average speed answered = AVERAGE('Call Center'[Speed of answer in seconds])
- Count of Satisfaction Rating = COUNT('Call Center'[Satisfaction rating])
- Overall customer satisfaction = DIVIDE([Positive satisfaction rating], [Count of Satisfaction Rating], 0)
- Positive satisfaction rating = CALCULATE(COUNT('Call Center'[Satisfaction rating]), FILTER('Call Center', 'Call Center'[Satisfaction rating] IN {4,5}))
- Resolved = COUNTX(FILTER('Call Center', 'Call Center'[Resolved] = "Yes"), 'Call Center'[Resolved])
- Total calls = CALCULATE('New Measure'[Total calls answered] + 'New Measure'[Total calls unanswered])
- Total calls answered = COUNTX(FILTER('Call Center', 'Call Center'[Answered (Y/N)] = "Yes"), 'Call Center'[Answered (Y/N)])
- Total calls unanswered = COUNTX(FILTER('Call Center', 'Call Center'[Answered (Y/N)] = "No"), 'Call Center'[Answered (Y/N)])
- Unresolved = COUNTX(FILTER('Call Center', 'Call Center'[Resolved] = "No"), 'Call Center'[Resolved])
